# **Scratch 2 Legacy**

**Scratch 2 Legacy** provides a lightweight standalone version of the classic Scratch 2.0 editor. Many users have experienced issues downloading the **Scratch 2.0 Offline Editor** from the official website, as the download links are currently broken. **Scratch 2 Legacy** is here to provide an alternative way for users to continue editing and creating Scratch 2.0 projects offline, without relying on outdated software or broken links.

## **How This Was Made**

The **Scratch 2 Legacy** editor was created by using the **default SB2 file** from the **official Scratch 2.0 Offline Editor** and converting it into an **SWF** file using a third-party **SB2 to SWF converter** that was downloaded from the internet. Here's the process:

1. The **default SB2 file** from the **Scratch 2.0 Offline Editor** (the version you would normally use on your computer) was used as the base project.
2. The **SB2 to SWF converter** was then used to convert this file into **SWF** format. The converter includes an option called **"Enable Editor"**, which allows the **Scratch 2.0 editor** to run within the SWF file.
3. The resulting **SWF file** was packaged into a **standalone executable (.exe)** file, which opens the **Scratch 2.0 editor** in a lightweight, offline form.

Using the original, official **Scratch 2.0 Offline Editor** SB2 file ensures that the **Scratch 2 Legacy** editor provides the same experience as the original editor, but in a much more convenient, standalone package.

## **Why This Project Exists**

The **Scratch 2.0 Offline Editor** downloads from the official Scratch website are currently unavailable. This project exists to fill that gap by offering an easy-to-use, standalone **.exe** file that lets users run **Scratch 2.0** without needing Adobe AIR or any other dependencies.

- **No installation required**: Simply download and run the `.exe` file.
- **Offline editing**: No need for an internet connection to work on your Scratch 2.0 projects.

If you're unable to download the official **Scratch 2.0 Offline Editor** or if you're looking for a lightweight, alternative way to work with your older Scratch 2.0 projects, this project provides the perfect solution.
