# **Scratch 2 Legacy**

**Scratch 2 Legacy** provides a standalone version of the classic Scratch 2.0 editor as an `.exe` file, allowing you to run and edit Scratch 2 projects offline without needing Flash or a web browser.

## **Disclaimer: Security Warning**

This program relies on **Flash Player 11** and the **Flash Projector** to run the Scratch 2.0 editor. Since **Adobe Flash** was officially discontinued on December 31, 2020, **Flash Player** no longer receives updates or security patches. Running this program **poses security risks** to your system.

### **Important Notes:**
- This program **must be run as a standalone application** and **not in a browser**, as Flash is no longer supported in modern browsers.
- **Use at your own risk**: We cannot guarantee security when running outdated software.
- **Recommendation**: For maximum security, consider running this program in a **virtual machine** or on an isolated system to avoid exposing your main operating system to potential vulnerabilities.
