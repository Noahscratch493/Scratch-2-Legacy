# Scratch 2 Legacy

This project allows you to run **Scratch 2 Legacy** using the **Ruffle** Flash player emulator, making it possible to run and interact with Scratch 2 projects even though Flash is no longer supported in most modern browsers.

## Features

- **Autoplay Support**: The project automatically starts playing the Scratch 2 Legacy SWF file when loaded.
- **Responsive Design**: The Scratch 2 player will fill the entire browser window.
- **Full-Screen Experience**: The player scales according to your browser's size.

## Start Scratching

To start scratching in Scratch 2, simply visit the following link in your browser:

[Start Scratching in Scratch 2](https://noahscratch493.github.io/Scratch-2-Legacy)

This will load **Scratch 2 Legacy** in your browser, powered by the **Ruffle** Flash emulator.

## Old Method (Not Recommended)

**Warning**: This is the **old method**, and it is **no longer recommended**. Flash Player 11 is outdated and has been discontinued. This method comes with significant security risks, as Flash is no longer supported by most browsers or Adobe. **It is highly advised to use Ruffle instead**.

However, if you absolutely must use Flash Player 11 for any reason, you can download the standalone installer from the link below. Please note that we **do not own the site** and cannot guarantee the safety or integrity of the download.

1. Download **Flash Player 11** Standalone Installer from [this link](https://archive.org/download/standaloneflashplayers/fp/fp_10/10.0.12.36/flashplayer10r12_36_win_sa.exe).
2. Install Flash Player 11 on your machine.
3. Open the Scratch 2 Legacy SWF file by visiting [Scratch 2 Legacy SWF](https://noahscratch493.github.io/Scratch-2-Legacy/Scratch_2_legacy.swf) in the Flash Player 11 standalone application.

**Important**: Flash Player 11 is insecure and unsupported. For a safer experience, we recommend using the Ruffle method outlined above.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML file in your web browser.
3. The Scratch 2 Legacy SWF file will automatically load and begin playing.
