# Scratch 2 Legacy

**Scratch 2 Legacy** provides a standalone version of the classic Scratch 2.0 editor as an `.exe` file, allowing you to run and edit Scratch 2 projects offline without needing Flash or a web browser.

## How to Use This Program

1. **Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Noahscratch493/Scratch-2-Legacy/releases)** and download the latest release of the program.
2. **Extract the ZIP file** to a location of your choice.
3. **Open `Scratch2Legacy.exe`** to launch the Scratch 2.0 editor.

   > **Note:** The editor may take a few seconds to load. It may appear unresponsive for about 5 seconds, but after that, it will work as expected.

For the best experience, **maximize the window** to fullscreen.
